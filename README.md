 This tracks the expense and income of a person and with the help of speechly api it gets an additional feature of entries via voice and also the charts shows the analyzed data.

 ------> version 1 should be completed by 11/04/2024.

 In version 2 I am thinking for a few ideas:
 1. Lets say this application is for a firm 
 2. There can be multiple users for the same file.
 3. They all will have different roles. 
 4. So there will a sign up page and a login page .
 5. Two types of user 
    A. Owner 
    B. Employee
 6. Owner will give permission to the Employee to make changes in the and He can limit the access to    delete the data.
 7. Hence It will be full stack project from a frontend project. # expense-tracker
